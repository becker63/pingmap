# Pingmap
Application that very roughly calculates location given player ping time.

# Setup
### First get the data you need, run...
```
python main2.py
```
and select option 2

## Running
```
python main2.py
```
and select option 1

### This will print out a list of locations and a index.html that contains a map of the locations, if you would like to see the map run a small web server in this dir..
```
python -m http.server
```
### I will problaby automate a lot of this.
